# Cardiac Data Analysis - using Tableau
Project for Cardia Data Analysis in USA made by using tableau.

## Overview
Cardiac diseases are one of the leading causes of death in middle aged and old aged population. About 610,000 die of heart diseases in United States every year, that's 1 in 4 deaths. Healthcare is an inevitable task to be done in human life. Cardiovascular disease is a broad category for a range of diseases that are affecting heart and blood vessels. The early methods of forecasting the cardiovascular diseases helped in making decisions about the changes to have occurred in high-risk patients which resulted in the reduction of their risks.
Age, gender, smoking, family history, cholesterol, poor diet, high blood pressure, obesity, physical inactivity, and alcohol intake are risk factors for heart disease, and hereditary risk factors such as diabetes also lead to heart disease. But it is difficult to manually determine the probability of getting a heart disease based on the risk factors.
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and they include:

coronary heart disease – disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle
• cerebrovascular disease – disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain
• peripheral arterial disease – disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs
• rheumatic heart disease – damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria
• congenital heart disease – malformations of heart structure existing at birth
• deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism – blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs


We have used various Visualiations in Tableau to show how Cardiac problems impact to male and Female population. Furthermore we applied various ML models for Classifications of Data.
